================

Really simple Blog/Homepage. Probably not fit for general use but a good starting point.

Uses: Node, Express, Knex, Postgres, Jade, Passport, Marked, feed, and more.  Currently needs some massive clean up, design changes(and by this I mean design in general), and a better admin system.

1. Git pull the repo

2. npm install

3. Rename config-sample to config, update everything

4. npm run migrate

5. ...?
