================

Really simple Blog/Homepage CMS I'm currently working on as a learning exercise. Probably not really fit for use at this point, still have a lot of work to do.

Uses: Node, Express, Mongoose, Mongodb, Jade, Passport, Marked, feed, and more.  Currently needs some massive clean up, design changes(and by this I mean design in general), and a better admin system.

1. Git pull the repo

2. Npm install

3. Rename config-sample folder to config

4. Update all variables in config.js

5. Have fun figuring out all the steps that I haven't documented or made easy yet.
